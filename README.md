# QHack coding challenges 

This repository contains solutions of coding challenges from QHack - xanadu quantum hackathon. 

Coding challenge is an interesting part of each year QHack experience. It contains simple tasks in all of the today's quantum computing areas - quantum algorithms, chemistry, machine learning and games. These tasks are written in Pennylane language (Python). I will update this repo with every coding challenge I've solved in the upcoming QHacks.

The challenges are presented in Jupyter notebook format. They are organized according to the year, topic, and the original names for the challenges.
