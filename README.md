# QHack coding challenges 

This repository contains solutions of coding challenges from QHack - xanadu quantum hackathon. 

Coding challenge is an interesting part of each year QHack experience. It contains simple tasks in all of the today's quantum computing areas - quantum algorithms, chemistry, machine learning and games. These tasks are written in Pennylane language (Python). I will update this repo with every coding challenge I've solved in the upcoming QHacks.

# Navigation

The challenges are presented in Jupyter notebook format. They are organized according to the year, original name of the topic, and reward for the challenges.
